# Happy Birthday Github!

Github makes my life so much easier, reading about the growth of github [here](https://github.com/vassiki/happybirthday.git) made my day!

Hope this project keeps pushing forward, encouraging not just open source software development, but also open science!

Thanks for the github student pack, don't know what I would do without it!
